# Mrrr
*Mrrr* is a web comic created by Matt Col√≥n and Chris Hansen in 2002 to poke fun at college life, video games, anime, and more.  This web application represents bringing *Mrrr* to use modern web technologies and improve the user experience of the web page while maintaining the original visual design.

The primary goal of developing this web application is to practice web development fom scratch using what I have learned so far.  This incarnation of the web page is using Angular 1.6 because of my familiarity with that version while still wanting to have more practice with it, and CSS3 to simplify the display of layouts with flexbox and multiple background images in an element.  It also uses Gulp for its build system, Bower for JS dependencies, and Sass for CSS styles.
